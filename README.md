###Releasing updates###

Here in the beginning, we are probably going to release updates 
rather frequently to get a feel for what the best user experience
might be. Expect that we will be moving toward a fixed schedule - 
for instance every 2-3 weeks - when we have more templates submitted
from the Visual Studio community.
